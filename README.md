# go-nanoarch

go-nanoarch is an attempt to write a minimal libretro frontend in go. It is a port of https://github.com/heuripedes/nanoarch

As the C version:

> nanoarch is a small libretro frontend (nanoarch.c has less than 1000 lines of code) created for educational purposes. It only provides the required (video, audio and basic input) features to run most non-libretro-gl cores and there's no UI or configuration support.

It is tested on OSX and Linux.
